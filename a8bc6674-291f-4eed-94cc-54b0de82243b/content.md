SAN FRANCISCO -- October 1, 2018 -- In Monday's Wall Street Journal we announced our application for accreditation to award a Bachelor's degree program in Applied Computer Science to students beginning in January 2019. Launched in 2014 as an alternative to traditional 4-year colleges, Make School's alumni now work with top tech employers including Facebook, Google, Apple, and Tesla. If accredited, Make School will be the first institution of its kind approved by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC), which accredits traditional colleges, including Stanford, the University of California, Berkeley, and the California Institute of Technology.

"The college degree remains a powerful signal for students and employers alike, and our new program reflects the importance of pairing tech training with the very best of the liberal arts," said Make School co-founder Ashu Desai. "Students shouldn't have to choose between a degree and the sort of career-focused skills that have helped our alumni to chart their path to rewarding careers in tech, and beyond."

The unique degree program, which was designed with input from industry leaders at [more than 30 Silicon Valley employers, ](https://www.makeschool.com/partners)is rooted in a project-based curriculum that reflects the evolving needs of top technology firms. Students who opt into a unique, pay-for-performance model will only be responsible for tuition payments when their income exceeds $60,000.00. Make School only succeeds when our students succeed.

Under WASC's incubation model, Make School will collaborate with Dominican University of California, a small, independent college, on the development of a computer science program that will include both the Make School Bachelor's Degree and a minor in computer science available at Dominican University's campus, just north of San Francisco. WASC expects to complete its review of the degree program, now pending final approval, in November.

"40% of our students come from backgrounds underrepresented in tech. This new degree program provides a pathway to upward economic mobility by preparing students for successful careers in the world's fastest growing industry," said Jeremy Rossmann, co-founder of Make School.
