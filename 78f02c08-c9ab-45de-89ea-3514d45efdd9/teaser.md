We built our Summer Academy (SA) from 30 students in a living room to 210 students across San Francisco, New York City, and Sunnyvale. It's time to kick our growth into the next gear. We're looking to build partnerships with local individuals and organizations (co-working spaces, incubators, educational institutions, city governments, and more) to expand our Summer Academy across the country and around the world. We believe our brand of product education is critical in preparing the world's youth for the future economy - especially in cities with growing startup ecosystems.

We're looking for someone to drive the expansion of the Summer Academy by building new partnerships and inspiring youth to leverage software to solve problems in their communities. You’ll work closely with the Product Manager of the Summer Academy, with additional support from various team members. You’ll have high autonomy and authority with regard to SA expansion.
