*We asked our students to share their dreams with us! What do they hope to achieve during their time at Make School? In their careers? In the next 50 years? Here's [Unathi Chonco's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/unathichonco) response.*

Growing up in South Africa, I wasn't always exposed to the world as much as many people around here. South Africa, the Rainbow Nation, is a place that has been filled with an integration of cultures and people from all over the world. I believe this is why the move from to San Francisco has been a revitalizing culture shock pushing me forward rather than a scary one holding me back. I have always been a self motivated individual, inspired to continue on my journey by industry leaders and success stories, and truly pushed forward by doing what I am passionate about. Discovering my passion for programming leads back to realizing my ability to create something out of nothing, which sparked a fire that has only grown ever since. This burning desire to create, and conviction to change the world, impacting lives, is what makes me who I am: Not what I do, but what drives me to do that. Ultimately, who I am, and who I have become through personal development and experience, has brought me to [Make School](http://makeschool.com).
