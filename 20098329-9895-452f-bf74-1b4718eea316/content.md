This episode goes beyond “I told the truth” to a more difficult place – being honest with yourself, facing your fears, and coming into the world with all your honest hopes and insecurities.

Brad Blanton does exactly that. He curses. He calls you out. He’s been documented farting, unashamedly in front of reporters mid- interview. He’s spent the past 30 years as a psychiatrist and leader of the Radical Honesty movement and wrote a bestselling book by that name. He is hilarious.

I gave Brad full permission to tear me apart in our interview. We start with insecurity around dating.
