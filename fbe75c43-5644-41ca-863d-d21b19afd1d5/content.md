MakeSchool students spent their Saturday demonstrating the games they built at the Summer Academy. One hundred twenty students in Silicon Valley and New York City gathered to show their games to recruiters and guests at the MakeSchool Demo Day.

The students spent eight weeks learning iOS and building their own original games. They heard talks from industry experts who play-tested their games and gave them feedback. Students iterated on their games and polished them to be shipped to the App Store.

The Summer Academy Demo Day culminated in an awards ceremony for the top three games in each of the two Demo Day locations. The Audience Choice was also awarded for the game with the most votes from the Demo Day recruiters and guests. Students took away prizes from Amazon, including the Amazon Fire Tablet.

Demo Day was a great chance for all the students to show off the hard work and skills they put into their games during the Summer Academy, as well as make professional connections and interact with recruiters.
