Our emphasis is on building real world products and equipping students with the technical skills and professional network they need to build a successful career in tech.

We’ve grown to 15 people who joined the company from Hawaii, Michigan, Boston, Ohio and Germany. We’ve previously worked at startups, small businesses, game companies and tech companies. We’ve lectured and taught at MIT, Carnegie Mellon, UC Berkeley, Stanford and INSEAD. We frequently volunteer to teach beginners coding basics and mentor entrepreneurs building companies. We see each other as a family and work to treat each other better everyday. Our culture is fast paced yet fun and forgiving. We care deeply about improving computer science education, and sparking passion in students to build real products. We’re always looking to add new and diverse perspectives to the team, if you’re passionate about computer science education we’d love to hear from you!
