**About Make School**<br> Make School is building a 2 year university replacement that teaches software engineering, computer science theory and better prepares students for a career as a software developer or startup founder. Our emphasis is on building real world products and equipping students with the technical skills and professional network they need to build a successful career in tech. Students have zero out of pocket cost for the program, they pay tuition through earnings during and after the program with no risk and no debt. We also run the Summer Academy, a 2 month program where high school and college students learn to build and ship their first product and Online Academy, an online course based off a simplified version of the Summer Academy.

Make School was founded in 2012, we’ve taught over 500 students through in person courses and over a million students through online tutorials. We’ve grown to 10 people who joined the company from Hawaii, Michigan, Boston, Ohio and Germany. We’ve previously worked at startups, small businesses, game companies and tech companies. We’ve lectured and taught at MIT, Carnegie Mellon, UC Berkeley, Stanford and INSEAD. We frequently volunteer to teach beginners coding basics and mentor entrepreneurs building companies. We see each other as a family and work to treat each other better everyday. Our culture is fast paced yet fun and forgiving. We care deeply about improving computer science education, and sparking passion in students to build real products. We’re always looking to add new and diverse perspectives to the team, if you’re passionate about computer science education we’d love to hear from you!
