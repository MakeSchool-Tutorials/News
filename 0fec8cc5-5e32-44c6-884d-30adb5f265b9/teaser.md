The Make School community is the driving force in making our educational experience inspiring. Our students frequently share their experiences of exploring their passion for Computer Science on their own before finding a home at Make School. They see us as a community of hard-working, like-minded peers and mentors who have the potential to use technology to change the world.  As we scale our programs around the world, it's critical we continue to engage with our online community.  We're looking for a Growth Hacker to own all website growth and to direct traffic to our tutorials and online courses. You'll be responsible for driving more students to our high-quality content, collaborating with developers to iterate on the product, and improving engagement.  The online courses not only provide a more accessible way for students around the world to learn to code but also serve as an introduction into our in-person courses.
