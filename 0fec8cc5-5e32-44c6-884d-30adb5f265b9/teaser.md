We’re looking for an iOS developer to teach at our Summer Academy. You’ll be teaching students aged 13-25 how to build and ship their first product: an iPhone app or game! Our curriculum covers Objective-C, but also product design, prototyping, user testing, analytics, and more. The MakeSchool Summer Academy is where students go from having tinkered with CS to falling in love with it and your job will be to teach and mentor them throughout. You can teach in SF or NYC.
