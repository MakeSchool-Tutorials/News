We’re looking for an iOS developer to teach at our Summer Academy. You’ll be teaching students aged 13-25 how to build and ship their first product: an iPhone app or game! Our curriculum covers Objective-C, but also product design, prototyping, user testing, analytics, and more. The MakeSchool Summer Academy is where students go from having tinkered with CS to falling in love with it and your job will be to teach and mentor them throughout. You can teach in SF or NYC. Here's a taste of the students you'll be teaching: [Jacob Haff](https://www.crowdtilt.com/campaigns/help-a-cf-patient-fulfill-his-dream-of-coding/description), [Sam Jiminez](https://www.crowdtilt.com/campaigns/help-sam-design-and-program-an-iphone-game/description), [Harlan Kellaway](https://www.tilt.com/campaigns/help-me-become-a-dev-for-social-justice/description)

**What we’re looking for:**

 - Passion for teaching and teaching experience
 - Strong CS background and industry experience building real products (degree not required)
 - Significant iOS experience

You'll need to come to California (travel expenses covered) for 2 weeks of training in late May/early June, then you'll be in your location for a week of setup + the 8 weeks the program runs. If you're a good instructor and a good culture fit we'd look to bring you on board longer term and start giving you more responsibilities. Our team cares deeply about the problems in education we are trying to solve, and we'd love if you do too.
