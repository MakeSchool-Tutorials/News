Make School is building the Product University for aspiring software engineers and founders. Students spend two years learning computer science foundations, software engineering, and product development through a blend of individually paced, project-based learning and industry experience. Unlike traditional university, students have zero upfront cost for the program; they pay tuition through earnings.

We're looking for a growth hacker to build traffic to our tutorials and online courses.

We want you to own website growth, you'll be responsible for driving more students to our high quality content, working with devs to iterate on the product and improve engagement and optimizing the funnel into our in person courses.

<b>About Make School</b><br>Make School is building a university replacement for Computer Science.
The program spans two years, divided by a six month internship at a tech startup. Students learn the CS theory covered by traditional universities paired with the practical experience of building and shipping products plus soft skills such as ethics, storytelling, and interpersonal communication.<br><br>
Students network with successful founders and developers throughout the program, and are placed at a tech startup upon graduating. The program has no up front cost, students pay tuition through internship and post-grad job earnings. <br><br>
Our pilot class kicked off last September with eleven students, two chose Make School over MIT. They shipped apps like Stitch News and Refuge Restrooms (featured in Buzzfeed) and received offers from Snapchat, Pandora, Edmodo, Dailymotion, Dr. Chrono and more. <br><br>
We also run a two month Summer Academy teaching iOS development and our online curriculum powers courses at MIT and Carnegie Mellon.
