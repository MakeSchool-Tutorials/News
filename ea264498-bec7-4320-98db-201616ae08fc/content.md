How can we design projects to optimize our learning?

Bob Lenz and the Buck Institute has answers. His name may sound familiar - a previous guest on this podcast, Tom Vander Ark, recommended his work.

This topic of planning projects could be relevant to you in many ways. It could be relevant if you are a manager designing projects for employees, a teacher designing projects for students, or even you designing projects for yourself.

The episode helped me design my work in order to increase my motivation, incorporate expert feedback, contextualize my learning, and communicate my expectations to teammates better. This episode is dense and jam-packed but like any project, it’s ultimately rewarding. Oy I feel like a cheezy teacher now.

I hope that this podcast inspires learning for you as much as it did for me!

Let’s go!
