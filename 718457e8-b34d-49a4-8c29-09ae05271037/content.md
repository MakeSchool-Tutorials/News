Called “innovative and inspiring” by the American Counseling Association, licensed therapist and entrepreneur Bea Arthur has become a leader in the field of mental health care and telemedicine. With the goal of transforming traditional therapy into a more affordable and approachable experience, she created In Your Corner which provides instant, expert support when you need it. The Columbia University alum has worked with a variety of demographics including addicts in recovery, couples in crisis, and survivors of domestic violence. Her passion for self-care led her to start two wellness-based businesses and a thriving private practice all before the age of 30. She has been featured in Elle, MTV, Fast Company, Entrepreneur Magazine, Huffington Post, VentureBeat, NPR, and many many more. Arthur is also the first black female CEO from the US to be accepted into the prestigious Y Combinator accelerator program.
