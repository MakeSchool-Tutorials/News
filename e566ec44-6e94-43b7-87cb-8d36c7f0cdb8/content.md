Unless you went to a very progressive high school, you probably learned a lot more about the contributions men have made to science than the contributions women have made. Despite popular misconception, women in the sciences have long been making some of the most important discoveries and advances the world has ever known.

Whether you're looking to expand your knowledge of women in tech or want some light weekend reading, you're sure to find something both informative and enjoyable on this list of six great books about women in STEM.

## [Blazing the Trail: Essays by Leading Women in Science](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1482709430/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1482709430&linkCode=as2&tag=wo054b-20&linkId=a10f64c6c9de232b63a36944890b78db) by Emma Ideal & Rhiannon Meharchand

If your interest in the sciences extends beyond computers -- and even if it doesn't -- this collection of essays from today's leading physicists, chemists, and engineers is an inspiring and thoughtful read worthy of your time. Sharing both career success and personal anecdotes of what it's like to be a working woman scientist today, Blazing the Trail will leave you feeling empowered and inspired.

## [The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage: The (Mostly) True Story of the First Computer](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307908275?imprToken=cTDwR-7ugd9YctxI5Uxmeg&slotNum=6&ie=UTF8&tag=bustlebooks-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=0307908275) by Sydney Padua

Charles Babbage wrote a plan for an enormous calculating machine -- what would have been the first computer -- in the 1840s. Ada Lovelace then wrote footnotes for Babbage's work that were three times longer than the original treatise. In those notes, Ada wrote the first ever algorithm meant to be carried out by a machine, and thus she became the mother of computer science.Â 

This fun graphic novel imagines what might have happened if Babbage and Lovelace had actually made the computer they imagined.
