Make School is excited to announce that we are partnering with Google again this summer to be one of six extension sites for [Google's Computer Science Summer Institute (CSSI): Extension](https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/programs/computer-science-summer-institute/) program.  CSSI: Extension is an online, four-week introduction to computer science, designed for all students who have a passion for computer science---especially students from historically underrepresented groups in tech.  In addition to daily code-alongs and developmental workshops, students in the CSSI: Extension program have the opportunity to be a part of a larger CSSI network and learn from Googlers what it takes to be successful in the industry!

Similar to Make School's project-based learning model, CSSI: Extension is an intensive, interactive, hands-on, and fun program that seeks to inspire the tech leaders and innovators of tomorrow.  Participants will spend weeks learning p5 curriculum taught by a Make School instructor and Googler, in preparation for the final project week--a time where students will be working in groups to ideate, build, and present on a project of their choosing.

Last summer, Make School became a CSSI: Extension site for the very first time.  We welcomed 18 students into the program with the support of Lisa Tran, Cohort Advisor; Adriana Gonzalez, Technical Advisor; and Liya Tilahun, Teaching Assistant.  Students attended daily code-alongs, weekly cohort meetings, and other CSSI events focused on community-building.  Make School students who participated in CSSI: Extension last summer started the school year with a connection to other students, reported feeling more confident in their ability to code as a result of the program, and are now active leaders in our community (e.g., Student Ambassadors, Student Council Members, Event Coordinators, etc.).

##Student Testimonials

###Yin Chang, Class of 2022
To sum up my days in Google CSSI ‘20, I'd say: Inspiration, goosebumps and more inspiration! I got to meet all the CS enthusiasts from around the United States and every day I just breathed in and out the code and new exciting project ideas. Google CSSI really prepared me well to kick off the journey of computer science!

### Merissa Bridgeman, Class of 2022
CSSI is about learning and growing as a community. From hearing the experiences from software engineers in today’s industry, to collaborating on projects with students from around the country. This program made me feel at home in the CS community.
