Make School is excited to announce that we are partnering with Google again this summer to be one of six extension sites for [Google's Computer Science Summer Institute (CSSI): Extension](https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/programs/computer-science-summer-institute/) program.  CSSI: Extension is an online, four-week introduction to computer science, designed for all students who have a passion for computer science---especially students from historically underrepresented groups in tech.  In addition to daily code-alongs and developmental workshops, students in the CSSI: Extension program have the opportunity to be a part of a larger CSSI network and learn from Googlers what it takes to be successful in the industry!

Similar to Make School's project-based learning model, CSSI: Extension is an intensive, interactive, hands-on, and fun program that seeks to inspire the tech leaders and innovators of tomorrow.  Participants will spend weeks learning p5 curriculum taught by a Make School instructor and Googler, in preparation for the final project week--a time where students will be working in groups to ideate, build, and present on a project of their choosing.

Last summer, Make School became a CSSI: Extension site for the very first time.  We welcomed 18 students into the program with the support of Lisa Tran, Cohort Advisor; Adriana Gonzalez, Technical Advisor; and Liya Tilahun, Teaching Assistant.  Students attended daily code-alongs, weekly cohort meetings, and other CSSI events focused on community-building.  Make School students who participated in CSSI: Extension last summer started the school year with a connection to other students, reported feeling more confident in their ability to code as a result of the program, and are now active leaders in our community (e.g., Student Ambassadors, Student Council Members, Event Coordinators, etc.).
