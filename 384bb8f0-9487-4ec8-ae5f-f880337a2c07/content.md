Ted Dintersmith is on the forefront of innovation in K-12 education. He has a unique background thatâ€™s part venture capitalist, part author, part educator, and part filmmaker. So, he thinks a lot about the future of technology, future of employment, how we prepare students for that future, and how to get the word out.

His latest work is Mostly to Succeed - a book and documentary about the teachers who he believes are truly preparing our students for the 21st and 22nd centuries. We talk about how these teachers help cultivate skills like facing ambiguity, creativity, innovation, independence, and the role that technology plays in all of it.
