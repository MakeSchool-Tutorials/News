<b>About Make School</b><br>
Make School is building a university replacement for Computer Science.
The program spans two years, divided by a six month internship at a tech startup. Students learn the CS theory covered by traditional universities paired with the practical experience of building and shipping products plus soft skills such as ethics, storytelling, and interpersonal communication.<br><br>
Students network with successful founders and developers throughout the program, and are placed at a tech startup upon graduating. The program has no up front cost, and instead students pay tuition through internship and post-grad job earnings. <br><br>
Our pilot class kicked off September 2014 with eleven students, two of whom chose Make School over MIT. They shipped apps like Stitch News and Refuge Restrooms (featured in Buzzfeed) and received offers from Snapchat, Pandora, Edmodo, Dailymotion, Dr. Chrono and more. <br><br>
We also run a two month Summer Academy teaching iOS development, and our online curriculum powers courses at MIT and Carnegie Mellon.
