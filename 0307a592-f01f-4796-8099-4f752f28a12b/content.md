This episode is on the tactics to build a diversity and inclusion movement at your organization - - everything from convening the first meeting, implementing change, structuring inclusion into the organization’s DNA, what to do when issues inevitably arise, measure diversity ROI as well as growing your own abilities to check your biases and make your community stronger.

And our Guest is Dom Deguzman who has done exactly this at Twillio where she led a grassroots movement to start a Diversity and Inclusion department. She also runs a Diversity and Inclusion group with Freada Kapor to support over 100 other Bay Area companies who do similar work.
