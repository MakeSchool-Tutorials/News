Given his 360 view of education I wanted to get down to the basics. How to teach. How to engage students, how to motivate students, help them direct their own learning. We also cover the big picture on where innovation is happening in education, the biggest impact per dollar and how we as learners can benefit from all of this. It’s jam-packed. The episode is an index into many of Tom’s favorite education thought leaders, methods and students. That’s just the start!
