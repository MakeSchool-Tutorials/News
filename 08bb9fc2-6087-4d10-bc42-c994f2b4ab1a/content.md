As we reflect on another week of self-isolation and social-distancing, I want to share a message of solidarity to the Make School community.

The consequences of the pandemic are severe and will escalate before they abate. In light of the upcoming uncertainty in the job market, I would like to assure our students and community that we remain committed to our core financial model: *if graduates don't have a job, they don't have to pay*.  To operate sustainably in this riskier climate, we had to cut resources from growing enrollments and building new products to focus on instruction and core operations. As a result of this shift in focus, Make School made the heartbreaking decision to conduct layoffs last week. No instructional staff were affected and we will still bring on 9 new faculty and student support hires this summer to support our next class of students.

Make School has been operating remotely and online-only since March 9th. We are immensely proud of how quickly our faculty were able to adapt. Operations are by no means perfect, but all classes will run as planned and we are grateful to our students for helping us iterate and improve. In a couple weeks we will update the community with our pain points and learnings from teaching online. If you would like to learn more about how we are adapting to remote learning, [please join](https://apply.makeschool.com/register/?id=91e6d3fa-b86f-40d1-a237-438c6023d932) our upcoming webinar on Thursday, April 2nd at 5pm PST.

While we hope to welcome our next class onsite in San Francisco come August, the health and safety of our students is our top concern. If necessary, we are prepared to welcome new Make School students remotely this fall and operate online for as long as needed.

There is a chance that most colleges across the country are not able to welcome students on campus until 2021. That global uncertainty is having a very personal impact. I am feeling what most of us are feeling - there are so many voices sharing so many possible courses of action that it feels harder than ever to predict what the world will look like even two weeks out, let alone months out. Truth be told, we know this will end, but we don't know when. If we have to stay in isolation this fall, we will rethink the college experience to bring our community together even if we are far apart.

All of us will experience some form of isolation if we haven't already. They call it 'social distancing', but what is most important is to remain socially close while physically distant. If you are looking for a community with whom to share project ideas and find like-minded collaborators, I'd like to extend an invite to the Make School Community Slack.

I would also like to share a daily checklist that has helped me while in isolation:

1.  Who am I checking in on today? 
2.  How am I getting exercise today? 
3.  How can I improve my living space today?

The next few weeks will be a challenge to your mental and physical health. Connecting (and reconnecting) with loved ones, staying physically active, and [seeking out professional help if you need it](https://www.betterhelp.com/) are critical to all of our well-being. It will be tempting to consume the endless amount of news over the coming weeks, but I urge our community of makers to take this opportunity to learn and create.

Separate but together, we will make it through this,  
Jeremy and Ashu
