**Make School and #YesWeCode are partnering for the second year in a row to get more Oakland-based students prepared with 21st century skills for a career in the tech industry.**

Together we’re providing [25 full tuition scholarships with a transportation stipend](https://www.makeschool.com/summer-academy/san-francisco/?code=Yeswecode2018). We will also cover housing and Macbooks for a select few.  

The 25 Oakland-based students will be part of a cohort of 150 students from around the world.  Students will learn iOS or web development and they will have launched their own iPhone App or website by the end of the 6-week program. Students will represent the local Oakland community and culture while making a global, lifelong network. Apply for a scholarship to the Summer Academy [here](https://www.makeschool.com/apply?code=Yeswecode2018).

**The partnership between YesWeCode and Make School is part of a larger movement to tackle the diversity problem in Silicon Valley.**

> “We’re excited to partner with YesWeCode for a second time to provide students in need with a path into the tech industry. With our recently revamped Summer Academy, we’re committed to making our programs more accessible. And as a result, YesWeCode and Make School are together able to provide bright, talented scholars from Oakland more support than ever to pursue their dream careers.” -   Dion Larson, Head of Summer Academy
