We're living in a watershed moment. Our laws and our constitution guarantee equal treatment for women in the workplace, but as the #MeToo movement and revelatory pieces written by prominent women in tech have made painfully clear, those legal protections continue to be hindered by a patriarchal culture infected by nostalgia.

Today, only 11% of Silicon Valley executives are women, and only 7% of investor money goes to women-led startups, according to [Women Who Tech](https://www.womenwhotech.com/resources). As more women continue to speak up and demand more for themselves and their companies, these persistent disparities will finally begin to crumble and give way to gender and cultural diversity.

To help speed up the process, a number of companies and non-profit organizations actively support women in tech. Here are six of our current favorites.

## For Mentorship & Membership...

[National Center for Women & Information Technology](https://www.ncwit.org/) - NCWIT wants to revolutionize the face of tech. The organization's overall goal is to get more women participating in computing. Their website explains, "NCWIT equips change leaders with resources for taking action in recruiting, retaining, and advancing women from K--12 and higher education through industry and entrepreneurial careers." NCWIT puts on an annual summit and has a number of programs for company and individual members.

Other organizations that bring together communities of women in tech include [AnitaB.org](https://anitab.org/), [WITI](https://www.witi.com/), the [Society of Women Engineers](http://societyofwomenengineers.swe.org/), and [TechWomen](https://www.techwomen.org/).

## For Networking...

[Tech Ladies](https://www.hiretechladies.com/join) - A great online networking option, Tech Ladies members get access to a great jobs page with access to roles at Slack, Adobe, Etsy, BuzzFeed, and more. Members also get access to the Tech Ladies Facebook group that serves as a great forum for discussion and support as a woman in tech.

Other online networking resources include Y Combinator's [Leap](https://leap.ycombinator.com/). And if you're interested in meeting women in person - women in tech in the Bay Area regularly get together for dinner, inspiring talks, and networking through [Girl Geek X](http://girlgeek.io/). A similar breakfast group for NYC women in tech is [Techfest](http://www.techfest-club.com/).

## For Competitions...

[Women Who Tech - Women Startup Challenges](https://www.womenwhotech.com/women-startup-challenge) - Supported by such companies as Google, Microsoft, and IBM, the Women Startup Challenges are annual pitch competitions for early-stage women-led tech startups. The goal of each challenge is "to disrupt a culture and economy that has made it exceedingly difficult for women entrepreneurs to access capital."

Other competitions specifically for women in tech include the [Tech Lady Hackathon + Training Day](https://techladyhackathon.org/) and [LadyHacks](http://ladyhacks.org/).

## For Training...

[The Refinery](http://therefineryct.com/#home) - This organization is just three years old, but so far it has helped 39 women-led companies raise over $20 million in funding and paired the leaders with over 90 mentors. The Refinery's mission is stated quite simply: "To fuel the growth and close the funding gap of women-led companies."

Other organizations focused on helping women launch successful businesses include [Aviatra Accelerators](http://aviatraaccelerators.org/).

## For Reading...

[Women 2.0](http://www.women2.com/) - This blog is filled with helpful information and articles written for women in business. While the site addresses workplace issues generally, many of the articles focus on the tech industry. Women 2.0 also has a helpful job board with many tech jobs around the country.

Other blogs worth checking out include [HackerChick](http://hackerchick.com/) and [The Female Perspective of Computer Science](http://compscigail.blogspot.ca/).

## For Funding...

[Women's Venture Capital Fund](http://www.womensvcfund.com/) - This venture capital fund specifically invests in companies led by women that focus on digital media products for women. According to their investment focus page, "Given the universal embrace of digital media and the evolution of technologies, platforms, products and services, the WVCF has identified a myriad of women-centric opportunities in Software Solutions, Mobile Products, Social Media, and Digital Content."

Other venture capital funds focused on women-led startups include [Golden Seeds](http://www.goldenseeds.com/) and the [Female Founders Fund](https://femalefoundersfund.com/).

## Even More Resources...

This list is just a jumping off point. There are a ton of awesome organizations and spaces for women to take part in, meet with each other, and create stronger networks. Another great article to check out is one over at Envato's blog - [Coding Like a Girl: Resources for Women in Tech and Developer Roles](https://envato.com/blog/coding-like-girl-resources-women-tech-developer-roles/).
