**Make School students selected for the program will earn a salary and have their tuition fully paid for by studying at Make School while concurrently working remotely for Shopify.**

**SAN FRANCISCO, CA (June 9, 2021)** -- Shopify and Make School are partnering to expand Shopify's work-integrated Bachelor's degree program into the United States. Shopify's Dev Degree program, now in its fifth year, combines an accredited computer science degree with hands-on developer experience at the company. Dev Degree's program in partnership with Make School is a fully remote 3-year program currently available for aspiring software engineers living in select U.S. states and Canada, removing barriers for students that were once restricted by a physical office or campus.

Students will divide their time working remotely at Shopify, while studying at Make School as they work towards attaining a Bachelor of Science in Applied Computer Science. They will be paired with a Make School coach and a Shopify mentor, combining academic rigor with real world experience. As part of the program, Shopify covers students' full tuition and pays them a salary, allowing students to kick-start their careers without the burden of student debt.

"The Dev Degree program is excited to adapt to a fully remote-first mindset through Shopify's partnership with Make School," said Alison Evans Adnani, Dev Degree Program Lead. "We're opening up possibilities for more students across North America desiring an experience to both learn and work remotely, and paving the way for structuring innovative work-integrated learning programs."

The new partnership between Shopify and Make School builds on Make School's commitment to work-integrated learning programs, like Dev Degree, that will lead to a more diverse, competitive, and highly-skilled workforce - especially as barriers in the global market continue to disappear.

"Make School is founded on the belief that real-world experience is an essential component to learning. In the spirit of that belief, we are excited to partner with Shopify's Dev Degree program on our shared mission to provide students with deep practical experience working in the tech industry," says Dr. Anne Spalding, Dean and Interim President at Make School.

Dev Degree offers fast-track learning and ties theory to real-life product development practice. The program will welcome 30+ new students in September across its three programs with Make School, Carleton University (Ottawa, Canada), and York University (Toronto, Canada), resulting in a milestone of over 100+ students being accepted into the program since its founding in 2016. Applications for Dev Degree's Fall 2022 intake open mid-September for students considering applying for this innovative work-integrated learning program.
