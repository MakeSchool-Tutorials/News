The MakeSchool team and Gap Year students paired up to help give back to the community and spread holiday cheer at the MSC Homeless Shelter near our office. Everyone worked together to help make garlands and paint decorations. 

Additionally, the shelter provides fresh linens to each guest every night, which means large volumes of sheets and blankets are washed and folded every day. A subset of the MakeSchool volunteers spent their time together at the shelter helping fold linens. 

The MSC Homeless Shelter is the largest shelter in Northern California. They feed, shelter and provide support to over four hundred men and women daily. After the volunteering session wrapped up, MSC staff took the MakeSchool team and students on a detailed tour of the shelter. They offer not only safe and warm beds, but also medical, mental health, employment and housing assistance.

It was heartwarming to learn how much hard work and dedication is put in by everyone at the shelter to create a positive experience for the guests. We are all looking forward to playing a larger part in creating that experience.

We plan to continue our service by serving food to the MSC shelter guests with weekly volunteering sessions to become an active and positive force in our neighborhood, beginning in January. This holiday volunteering session was just the beginning of what we hope will become a long and wonderful partnership with the MSC Shelter. 

The MSC Shelter relies on donations and volunteers to continue providing service to their guests. For more information on how to get involved, visit [http://svdp-sf.org/get-involved/](http://svdp-sf.org/get-involved/).
