We're looking for someone to wear many hats and keep the wheels on the bus as we step on the gas. You'll be responsible for making sure our office runs smoothly and that all staff and students are happy and productive. Youâ€™ll handle everything we throw your way with grace and a smile: from coordinating trips to Hackathons to making sure our office is stocked with everything we need.
