We aim to spread the Summer Academy experience around the country, and our growth goals are aggressive. This year we are piloting U.S. programs in Seattle, Chicago, Dallas, Washington DC, Boston, and Atlanta, while doubling our reach in the Bay Area, Los Angeles, and New York City. We are looking for a Lead Ambassador in each city to ensure the success of all 2017 Summer Academy locations.
