### Part 1: The Accreditation Process

Jeremy and I first began discussing the prospect of seeking accreditation three years ago --- shortly after we launched our two-year undergraduate computer science program. The discussion largely stemmed from feedback we heard from prospective students and parents --- especially those with backgrounds underrepresented in tech --- that a Bachelor's degree still held weight for them, their families, and their communities, even if employers no longer demanded it.

It was unclear at the time whether we'd be able to seek accreditation while preserving the exceptional relevance of our education for the modern economy and accessibility to students of all backgrounds. Specifically, we wanted to retain our progressive education pedagogy (project based, learn by making), our emphasis on delivering top tier career outcomes to our students, our teaching corps with industry --- rather than academic --- experience, and our innovative debt-free pay as you earn tuition model. We wanted to be uncompromising, maintain our radical model of rapidly iterative and innovative higher education *and* offer an accelerated degree path to our students.

The higher education climate has shifted substantially over the past three years, with [university presidents increasingly concerned](https://www.makeschool.com/blog/nyt-higher-ed-leaders) about the relevance and accessibility of their institutions. Accreditors --- due to pressure from both students and the federal government --- have begun evaluating how to emphasize measurement of student outcomes and how to enable faster innovation throughout higher ed. WASC --- the west coast regional accreditor, which accredits the elite west coast institutions --- introduced the incubation model, a faster path for upstart colleges to seek accreditation by serving an apprenticeship under an existing college. The incubation model provided opportunity for us to marry the strong benefits of accreditation --- a thoughtful framework to ensure quality education at scale --- with a nimbler institutional model --- no tenure, no PhD requirements for faculty, and the ability to rapidly experiment and iterate on courses.

Two years ago, we met Mary Marcy, President of Dominican University of California, a deeply thoughtful and forward thinking leader of a small liberal arts college in San Rafael, 15 miles north of San Francisco. Mary had just introduced a new initiative at her institution --- called the Dominican Experience --- pairing liberal arts with career focused education, emphasizing project based learning, and providing support for first-gen and underrepresented students of color. Her next initiative was to introduce computer science education to Dominican, to help students across all majors develop 21st century skills.

Mary and the Dominican team proved to be perfect partners to help us apply for accreditation under WASC's incubation model. Make School would support Dominican in the development of career-relevant computer science courses as part of a new computer science minor delievered on their campus. Dominican would provide us mentorship and resources to ensure our curriculum, policies and procedure, and student support meet the standards set by WASC and the federal government.

Two weeks ago we hosted representatives of WASC for a site visit --- the final step before WASC holds a committee meeting to approve the program in November. Jeremy did an inspiring job in leading the two year process of applying for accreditation, supported by the strong exectution of our entire team. We've so far received immensely positive feedback from WASC on our proposal --- and permission to accept applications for the accredited program --- due to both our innovative model of higher education and the attention to detail and thoughtfulness with which we've been running our institution over the past four years.
