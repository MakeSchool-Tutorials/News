Want to be a successful software engineer someday? Learning programming won't get you there. Engineers who are successful in any company big or small are first and foremost product developers. They understand products and the people that use them; pain points and preferred solutions. So how do you start learning to build products? Through a combination of a logical identification of the problems in the industry you're building a solution for, research about the current landscape, and an analysis of your potential users. All this happens even before your first wireframe.

-   Industry Selection -- what problem did you select and why? Hypothesis on solutions? Skepticisms? Curiosities? Questions?

-   PEST analysis -- is the timing right for your application idea? Use the PEST analysis to argue whether the timing is right to ship your product, or do changes in society need to take place before your idea finds it's time (i.e. smartphones needed to be invented before Uber could be created). List out the PEST forces shaping your industry.

-   Competitive analysis - what other technologies exist in your domain that are related to your problem. What "competitive advantage" (additional or different benefits) does your solution provide compared to existing solutions?  Create a "competitive matrix" or "grid" graphic to visualize your research. Include this graphic in your post.

-   User Interviews -- what is the value of doing user interviews? share some of your user interview questions and state why they are not biased. Who did you interview? What were your insights?

-   Advice from Industry Contacts -- who did you contact? What did you ask given your limited amount of time? What did you get out of the call?

-   Networking Event (optional) -- what event did you go to? What did you seek to learn? Who did you talk to and what did you learn?

-   MY IDEA -- how is your idea a synthesis of prior research? Fill out the sentence to state your idea simply: "I help [demographic], achieve [benefit or goal], through [what my technology does]." Be sure to mention how your idea adds a unique benefit or has a competitive advantage over other products.

-   User Journey -- share your user journey; share why you made a user journey and how it will guide your project?

-   Wireframes -- what is a wireframe and why did you create one? Take a photo of your hand-drawn (or digital) wireframe to include as an image in your post. Where do you hope to take the product from here?

One of the assignments students turn in during their first SPD term at Make School is a 1500 word analysis of the product development process for their products. Over the next few weeks, we'll share some of our favorite product analyses with you as examples of how to think like a successful engineer.`
