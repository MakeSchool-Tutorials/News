For some MakeSchool alumni, the end of the fall season of collegiate hackathons means the chance to finally catch a breath of air. Three of the top college hackathons were organized by MakeSchool alums: Katie Siegel, Carole Touma, and Scotty Shaw. 

HackMIT’s co-director for the second year in a row, Katie Siegel, saw over one thousand students working on cutting-edge technology. Carole Touma assisted in the organization of HackPrinceton, where people stepped out of their comfort zones as they worked on software and hardware projects. At HackDuke, Scotty Shaw helped a “Hackathon for Social Good” run smoothly.

MakeSchool sponsored and mentored at each of the hackathons. It was tons of fun helping students of all levels working on cool and varied hacks! We also loved seeing all the fantastic ideas being brought to life.
