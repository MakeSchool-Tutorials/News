For some MakeSchool alumni, the end of the fall
season of collegiate hackathons means the chance to
finally catch a breath of air. Three of the top college
hackathons were organized by MakeSchool alums.

HackPrinceton, organized by Carole Touma, had
people stepping out of their comfort zones as they worked
on software and hardware projects. Katie Siegel’s HackMIT
saw over one thousand students working on cutting­edge
technology. At HackDuke, Scotty Shaw helped a
“Hackathon for Social Good” run smoothly.

MakeSchool sponsored and mentored at each of
the hackathons. It was tons of fun helping students of all
levels working on cool and varied hacks! We also loved
getting to see all the fantastic ideas being brought to life.
