For some MakeSchool alumni, the end of the fall season of collegiate hackathons means the chance to finally catch a breath of air. Three of the top college hackathons were organized by MakeSchool alums: Katie Siegel, Carole Touma, and Scotty Shaw. 

HackMIT’s co-director for the second year in a row, Katie Siegel, saw over one thousand students working on cutting-edge technology. Carole Touma assisted in the organization of HackPrinceton, where people stepped out of their comfort zones as they worked on software and hardware projects. At HackDuke, Scotty Shaw helped a “Hackathon for Social Good” run smoothly.

MakeSchool sponsored and mentored at each of the hackathons. It was tons of fun helping students of all levels working on cool and varied hacks! We also loved seeing all the fantastic ideas being brought to life.  

The students at HackMIT loved the two different Build-Flappy-Bird workshops that we hosted, filling the room up both times as we coded in Objective-C and Swift, respectively. We were paired to mentor over ten different teams building brilliant iOS apps, along with providing coding help to hackers throughout the hackathon. 

Hackers at HackPrinceton were given a workshop on “How to Break Into Tech”, a chance for interactive advice on networking and getting a job in the tech industry. Princeton’s hackathon had a packed house, filled to the brim with students working on challenging and innovative projects. They also broke the Guinness World Record for the number of balloons blown up in one minute!

There were some amazing hacks to improve lives around the globe at HackDuke, where MakeSchool hosted workshops for students of all levels. Beginners and experts alike honed iOS and game development skills. 

Congratulations to Carole Touma, Scotty Shaw and Katie Siegel for all your hard work! We can’t wait until next year.
