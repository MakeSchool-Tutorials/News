People of color are underrepresented in the tech industry.

A [study by Fortune](http://fortune.com/2015/07/30/tech-companies-diveristy/) reveals that women held one third of the jobs in companies like LinkedIn, Microsoft, and HP. Within these companies, less than 1 percent are Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders and Native Americans, 5 percent are blacks, and 7 percent are Hispanics.

The numbers are even [worse on top](http://fortune.com/2015/07/30/tech-companies-diveristy/). Native Americans and Native Hawaiians hold 0.1 percent of leadership within large tech companies and 23.58 percent belonged to people in other ethnicities. Not surprisingly, 76.42 percent of top positions were held by whites.

Why do you need diversity?

When you're working on a tech product for a business that provides solutions to people around the world, diversity is extremely important. You want to get perspectives from different cultures and races. You want to make all your employees feel confident to be their authentic selves. And diversity leads to better retention and equity.

Plus, diversity helps businesses.

[Research by McKinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/why-diversity-matters) found that companies in the top quartile for racial and ethnic diversity were 35% more likely to have above-median financial returns.

And [research published on Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/eriklarson/2017/09/21/new-research-diversity-inclusion-better-decision-making-at-work/#577655764cbf) indicates that inclusive teams make better business decisions up to 87% of the time.

The tech industry is predominantly male. [Women Who Tech found](http://www.recruitingblogs.com/profiles/blogs/7-eye-opening-statistics-about-women-and-minorities-in-tech) that 40 percent of women females still believed that companies aren't doing enough to address the gender gap.

The good news is there have been more diversity and inclusion leaders over the past year. Check out our list to learn about the leaders you should follow in 2018.
