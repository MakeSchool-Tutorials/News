**About MakeSchool**<br> MakeSchool is building a 2 year university replacement that teaches software engineering, computer science theory and better prepares students for a career as a software developer or startup founder. Our emphasis is on building real world products and equipping students with the technical skills and professional network they need to build a successful career in tech.
