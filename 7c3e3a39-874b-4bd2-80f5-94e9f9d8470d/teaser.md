The Make School Summer Academy is an eight week program where students of all ages build and ship their own iOS app or VR experience. Locations have included San Francisco, Sunnyvale, Los Angeles, New York City, Singapore, Taipei, Hong Kong, and Tokyo. 

Los Angeles is one of our highest growth potential locations. We are looking for a local City Manager to fully plan and execute our next LA Summer Academy. You will have full autonomy to create a stellar program and experience, while communicating with our Expansion team for guidance and support.
