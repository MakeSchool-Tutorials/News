We’re looking for a rails developer to teach the web development portion of our new gap year program. You’ll be teaching students aged 18-25 how to build and ship their first website! Our curriculum will cover Ruby on Rails and HTML/CSS/JS, you’ll get to heavily influence the curriculum for this year and the future. You’ll also get to help guide the students' product ideas, help them understand how to effectively code on a team and prepare them to become professional developers or startup founders. Our students are some of the brightest in the nation, they’ve been coding for years, have already shipped iOS games and apps and have a passion for building great products. It’s an exciting opportunity to help inspire the next generation of makers and help define the future of CS education.

**What we’re looking for:**

 - Passion for teaching and teaching experience
 - Strong CS background and industry experience building real products (degree not required)
 - Significant experience with RoR/HTML/CSS/JS (bonus for having scaled a rails app)



**The position would start mid-november at the latest**, we’d be happy to have you start right away to help develop the curriculum. The teaching period will last 3 months, after which you would contribute to curriculum development, website development and a variety of other areas. Our team cares deeply about the problems in education we are trying to solve and enjoys working directly with students, we’d love if you do too. It’s a fast paced, casual and fun environment. We’re a tight knit group of 8, our team has moved from Hawaii, Michigan, Germany and Boston to join us in San Francisco and we're always looking to add diverse perspectives to the team.
