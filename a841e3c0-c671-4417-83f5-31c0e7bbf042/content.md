How do you navigate your quest to live a full life?

How do you prioritize work versus family, stretch yourself while maintaining your wellness?

Acclaimed civil rights activist Noël Gordon Jr has a unique perspective. He’s not trying to optimize for career or happiness. He points somewhere else.

What's most surprising: Noël is incredibly accomplished, and he says his focus on other priorities has driven his success.

At 24, Noël won the employee of the year award while serving as Senior Program Specialist at the Human Rights Campaign, America's leading LGBTQ civil rights organization. Noël has advised the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator and U.S. Delegation to the United Nations on issues affecting LGBTQ people, and his work has been mentioned or quoted in more than 300 publications nationwide, including USA Today and Teen Vogue.

This episode changed my life. I hope it changes yours too.
