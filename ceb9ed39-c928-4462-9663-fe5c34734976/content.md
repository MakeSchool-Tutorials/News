The programming industry is booming and has grown substantially over the course of the last decade. In fact, the [Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/computer-programmers.htm#tab-1) estimated that between 2012 and 2022, jobs in programming will grow by 8%. In addition, in 2019, the BLS estimated that the average salary for computer programmers in the U.S. was over $86k per year or over $41.00 per hour. This means the outlook for this career path is quite good.

Due to the growth of this tech-based field, young adults have become intent on turning their interest into a full blown career in programming. The only thing standing in their way? Not knowing where to begin.

Some people try and learn programming on their own while others find that attending college is the best option for them. Though there isn't a concrete path to learning this all important skill, there are some steps that you can take that will help you get a jumpstart on your career in computer programming.

Ready to get started? Read on to learn a few tips that can help you break into this particular field:

## Ask Yourself Some Important Questions

Maybe you always knew that you wanted to become a programmer or maybe you just recently became interested in the field. Whatever the case may be, there are some important questions that you should ask yourself before jumping in:
-   Why do you want to become a programmer?
-   What interests you about this field of work?
-   Who inspired you to get into programming?
-   Are you passionate about programming?
-   Do you understand the demands of this profession and the types of roles that are available?
-   Have you looked into the types of jobs that are available for programmers?
-   Do you know a programmer you could speak to about their experience?

There are times when people may be interested in programming, but then find out that it's more of a hobby for them rather than a career. Like any job, you must be passionate about the work that you're doing and should enjoy going to work each and every day. If you find that you're still eager to get started with programming after asking yourself these crucial questions, then you're ready to move on to the next steps.

## Do Your Research

Once you've decided that programming is the right career field for you, you're going to want to start doing some research into what type of programming you'd like to focus on. There are numerous different programming languages and frameworks such as Python, Objective-C, Swift, Flask, Node.JS, Ruby on Rails, HTML/CSS/Javascript, AngularJS, Haskell, and Scheme (all of which you will learn while working towards your [Bachelor in Applied Computer Science Degree at Make School](https://www.makeschool.com/computer-science-degree)). Take some time to look into each language and framework and understand what they can be used for.

Below is a brief explanation of some programming languages and frameworks:
-   Python: Algorithms and theory
-   Objective-C and Swift: App development
-   Flask: Backend development
-   Node.JS and Ruby on Rails: Web backend development
-   HTML/CSS/JavaScript and AngularJS: Front-end development

There are also other tools within these languages that may be fascinating to learn. For example, React JavaScript (React JS for short) is a front-end development tool that makes it really easy to create interactive UIs. It was originally developed by Facebook and is now widely used for single pages and mobile apps.

## Find the School That's Right For You

The last step that you're going to want to take is to start researching schools that offer a degree in computer science. Though there are numerous different types of schools that you can choose from, some schools are going to get you to your goal (a career in programming) faster than others.

For example, most colleges and universities solely offer 4 year degree programs, but on the other hand, there are options such as [Make School](https://www.makeschool.com) where you can earn your degree in only 2.5 years. Do your research, understand your options, and choose the school that will ultimately help you accomplish your goals in the timeframe you desire.

Some questions to consider when researching computer programming colleges:
-   What makes this school unique?
-   Why do students choose this school?
-   How long will it take me to earn your degree?
-   How much will it cost?
-   Does the school offer financial aid?
-   How does the school support students both while in school and after the graduate?
-   What do alumni say about the school?
