#### _Make School’s new online enrollment means you can earn a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science remotely in 2.5 years. The new modality also increases accessibility to a quality computer science education on a global scale—especially for students from backgrounds that are traditionally underrepresented in technical fields._

**SAN FRANCISCO, CA (February 2, 2021)** - According to the [American Talent Initiative](https://americantalentinitiative.org/), a national organization funded by Bloomberg, [paying for college tuition is not the primary financial problem for low- and moderate-income students. It's actually the cost of living](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jennifertescher/2019/03/14/admission-scandal-misses-the-point/?sh=a510c06d6954). Luckily, there are non-traditional colleges that are creating solutions on both fronts. Make School, a college that has built its reputation around putting students and student outcomes first, just announced an expansion of its Bachelor's Degree in Applied Computer Science program to include online enrollment*. Once a student is accepted, they will have the option to enroll as an On-Campus or Online student starting with the Fall 2021 term. The new online enrollment option means that students can earn their degree without relocating to San Francisco where the Make School campus is located.

All Make School students will participate in the same online lectures, and have dedicated student support and opportunities to interact with peers, faculty, teaching assistants, and industry guests [whether they opt to enroll on-campus or online](https://www.makeschool.com/computer-science-degree/enrollment-options).

"Industry norms have shifted significantly and remote work is already a significant part of modern tech life. By giving our students the ability to decide where they want to experience Make School, we are evolving with the modern workplace," says Make School Founder, Jeremy Rossmann.

Make School has a project-based curriculum that is built in partnership with Silicon Valley companies such as Lyft, Microsoft, Yelp, and Spotify. The accelerated degree program resembles the typical work week of a tech professional. Because of this unique structure, students are able to graduate in just two and a half years whether they enroll on-campus or online.

All Make School applicants will be held to the same standard. There is only one application and admissions process. However, Make School's criteria is quite different than most traditional colleges. Rather than focus on standardized test scores and grades, the selection process takes a holistic view of a student's experience and achievements both inside and outside the classroom. Programmers of all levels, even those without prior experience are welcome.

"As long as you have a love of problem-solving and are interested in impacting your community or the world in a positive way, you are a prime candidate for admission," says Emily Sheldon who recently joined Make School as the Head of Admissions from MIT.  "We strive to be a welcoming and inclusive community for all learners."

Make School’s online enrollment option and approach to admissions are designed to increase accessibility to a quality computer science education. The majority of Make School students have come from low to mid-income families, while nearly half identify as a racial or ethnic group that has been historically excluded from higher education. With the introduction of online enrollment, Make School hopes to have an even broader reach both in the U.S. and abroad.
