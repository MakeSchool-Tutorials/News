What motivates us? How can we motivate ourselves? Our guest today is a legend in the psychology world, Dan Pink. He’s often credited for paving the paved the path for authors of other character trait-oriented books, including many of the authors who have been on this podcast. And he’s so well regarded that at this point if I see an amazing education organization I just assume he’s on the board. In his groundbreaking book, "Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us", Dan uses 50 years of behavioral science to overturn the conventional wisdom about human motivation and offer a more effective path to high performance.

This episode is incredibly practical and I’ve since used it as my go-to-guide for when I feel like I’m in a slump. Dan talks on how to design your habits, routines, commitments, self-talk, and projects to increase your drive.

So if you want to be more motivated, this episode is for you. And, if you are a manager you may want to jump to minute (31) where Dan shares his top 5 tips for what organizations can do to increase their employee motivation.

It’s incredibly practical and will leave you with new techniques to be inspired.

Let's go!
