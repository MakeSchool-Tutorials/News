We had a blast at Make Hacks -- and we hope you did too! Thanks to all participants for coming out and making the first Make Hacks such a success. It was amazing to see so many people -- young and old, newbies and pros -- come together to hack at the Computer History Museum.  And of course, congratulations to the winning teams! 

Check out the Make Hacks recap video our friend Alton Sun put together for us!
