Stanford, Harvard, Yale, MIT... it can be all too easy to get swept up in the glamour of those names. We're programmed from a young age to feel like getting into a top school with a great name is the key to career (and life) success. And it is true that being able to say "I went to Yale" carries weight, but that weight isn't always positive, and it isn't nearly as significant as we're led to believe.

When thinking about where you might want to go to school, name recognition and overall "ranking" of the school can be one of your consideration factors. There's certainly no harm in wanting to attend a prestigious school. The harm comes when name recognition becomes your main deciding factor over other, much more important considerations like fields of study, class size, location, cost, and campus culture.

Perfect School, Perfect Student... Imperfect Results

In a recent [New York Times op-ed](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/08/opinion/college-gpa-career-success.html), Adam Grant pointed out the pressure that students put on themselves to be the absolute best at the best possible school is misguided and can actually be detrimental to long-term success. Some recruiters actually avoid college grads with 4.0 GPAs out of worry that their perfectionism and by-the-book nature won't be well suited to a corporate environment that requires social intelligence, critical thinking, and creative skill. As Grant puts it:

"Academic grades [rarely assess](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/11/opinion/sunday/why-we-should-stop-grading-students-on-a-curve.html?module=inline) qualities like creativity, leadership and teamwork skills, or social, emotional and political intelligence. Yes, straight-A students master cramming information and regurgitating it on exams. But career success is rarely about finding the right solution to a problem --- it's more about finding the right problem to solve."

Likewise, you are not a sample student making a by-the-book decision about where to attend school. You're a person with interests and passions and preferences, and those parts of your personality should play as large a role as anything else in where you decide to go.

Case in point: in [this Reddit feed](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/a53476/harvard_isnt_heaven/), a student attending Harvard pointed out that going to Harvard was their dream, but the reality they were faced with once they arrived wasn't at all what they had hoped for. They found an atmosphere of extreme competition and anxiety that led more than a few classmates into serious mental health crises.

This isn't to say that Harvard or any other elite school might not be the right place for you. The point is that finding a school where you're free to study subjects that excite you, where you feel comfortable to make mistakes, and where you have the chance to work and bond with your fellow classmates is much more likely to prepare you for long term success than a school that simply has a fancy name.

The Resume Conundrum

There is one caveat to this argument that's worth addressing. When you apply to your first job out of college or to grad schools, it is possible that a fancy college name will help your resume stay in the "consider" pile. Whether they should or not, human resources departments do sometimes have biases towards what they know.

That said, one quality that you should look for in the right school for you is its ability to prepare you for the career of your choice. Your chosen school should prepare you with a modern, career-focused education. It should give you opportunities to connect with mentors and help you connect to the school's broader network of alumni (and perhaps even corporate partners). It should hold job fairs, provide interview prep, and encourage entrepreneurial projects -- whatever it takes to help ensure that you're ready to succeed at your first job and beyond.

A fancy name may help keep your resume in the pile a bit longer. But personal interests, well-rounded practical experience, and the ability to communicate your vision to others -- that's what gets you the job.
